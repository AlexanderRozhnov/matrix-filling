# Low-rank Approximations for Large Incomplete Matrices #

This is a project for Numerical Linear Algebra and Optimization Methods courses at Skoltech, 2017.

Team memebers:
- Liliya Ageeva
- Sergey Makarychev
- Aleksandr Rozhnov
- Anton Zhevnerchuk

There are three modules, each of them containes a documented implementation of one of the matrix-completion algorithms. Jupyter Notebook with the demonstration of their performances is represented as well. For more detailes see presentation and report.
